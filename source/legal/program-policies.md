The policies listed below play an important role in maintaining a positive
experience for everyone using the Pebble Mobile App(s) and the related Products.
Defined terms used here have the same meaning as in the Pebble Developer
Distribution Agreement. Be sure to check back from time to time, as these
policies may change.

## 1. Content Policies.

Our content policies apply to any content your Product displays or links to,
including any ads it shows to users and any user-generated content it hosts or
links to. Further, our content policies apply to any content from your Developer
Account, which is publicly displayed in the Pebble Mobile App(s), or any
webpages or marketing materials for your Products.

1. **1.1.** **Sexually Explicit Material.** Products that contain or promote
   pornography are prohibited. This includes sexually explicit or erotic
   content, icons, titles, or descriptions. Pebble has a zero-tolerance policy
   against child sexual abuse imagery. If we become aware of content with child
   sexual abuse imagery, we will report it to the appropriate authorities and
   delete the accounts of those involved with the distribution.

1. **1.2.** **Violence and Bullying.** Depictions of gratuitous violence are not
   allowed. Products should not contain materials that threaten, harass or bully
   other users.

1. **1.3.** **Hate Speech.** Pebble does not allow content advocating against
   groups of people based on their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability,
   gender, age, veteran status or sexual orientation/gender identity.

1. **1.4.** **Impersonation or Deceptive Behavior.** Don't pretend to be someone
   else and don't represent that your Products are authorized by or produced by
   another company or organization if that is not the case. Products, apps or
   the ads they contain also must not mimic functionality or warnings from the
   operating system or other apps. Products must not contain false or misleading
   information in any content, title, icon, description or screenshots.
   Developers must not divert users or provide links to any other site that
   mimics or passes itself off as another app or service. Products and apps must
   not have names or icons that appear confusingly similar to existing products
   or to apps supplied with the Device.

1. **1.5.** **Intellectual Property.** Don't infringe on the intellectual
   property rights of others (including, without limitation, patent, trademark,
   trade secret, copyright and other proprietary rights) or encourage or induce
   infringement of intellectual property rights. We will respond to clear
   notices of alleged copyright infringement. For more information or to file a
   Digital Millennium Copyright Act request, please see our Terms of Service,
   which can be found at {{ site.links.pebble }}/legal/terms_of_use.

1. **1.6.** **Personal and Confidential Information.** We don't allow
   unauthorized publishing or disclosure of people's private and confidential
   information, such as credit card numbers, government identification numbers,
   driver's and other license numbers, non-public contacts or any other
   information that is not publicly accessible.

1. **1.7.** **Illegal Activities.** Keep it legal. Don't engage in unlawful
   activities on your Products, such as the sale of prescription drugs without a
   prescription.

1. **1.8.** **Gambling.** We don't allow content or services that facilitate
   online gambling, including, but not limited to, online casinos, sports
   betting and lotteries, or games of skill that offer prizes of cash or other
   value.

1. **1.9.** **Dangerous Products.** We don't allow Products that harm, interfere
   with the operation of, or access in an unauthorized manner, networks, servers
   or other infrastructure. Don't transmit or link to viruses, worms, defects,
   Trojan horses, malware or any other items that may introduce security
   vulnerabilities to or harm user Devices, apps or personal data. Products that
   collect information (such as the user's location or behavior) without the
   user's knowledge (spyware) are prohibited. Malicious scripts and password
   phishing scams are also prohibited on the Pebble Marketplace, as are apps
   that cause users to unknowingly download or install apps from sources outside
   of the Pebble Marketplace. A Product downloaded from the Pebble Mobile App(s)
   may not modify, replace or update its own binary code using any method other
   than the update mechanism of the Pebble Mobile App(s).

## 2. System Interference.

1. **2.1.** **Consent to Changes.** Products downloaded from the Pebble Mobile
   App(s) (or its components or derivative elements) must not make changes to
   the user's Device and/or Companion Device outside of the app without the
   user's knowledge and consent. This includes behavior, such as replacing or
   reordering the default presentation of apps, widgets or the settings on the
   Device. If an app makes such changes with the user's knowledge and consent,
   it must be clear to the user which app has made the change and the user must
   be able to reverse the change easily or uninstall the app altogether.

1. **2.2.** **Advertisements.** Products and their ads must not display
   advertisements through system level notifications on the user's Device,
   unless the notifications derive from an integral feature provided by the
   installed app (e.g., an airline app that notifies users of special deals or a
   game that notifies users of in-game promotions).

1. **2.3.** **Disabling of Third-Party Apps.** Products must not encourage,
   incentivize or mislead users into removing or disabling third-party apps,
   except as part of a security service provided by the Product.

## 3. Network Usage and Terms.

Products must not create unpredictable network usage that has an adverse impact
on a user's service charges or their carrier's network. Products also may not
knowingly violate any third-party terms of service for allowed usage.

## 4. Spam and Placement in the Marketplace.

1. **4.1.** Do not post repetitive content.

1. **4.2.** Do not use irrelevant, misleading or excessive keywords in the
   Products' or apps' descriptions, titles or metadata.

1. **4.3.** Developers must not attempt to change the placement of any Products
   in the Pebble Mobile App(s) or manipulate any product ratings or reviews by
   unauthorized means, such as fraudulent installs, paid or fake reviews or
   ratings, or by offering incentives to rate Products.

1. **4.4.** Products that are created by an automated tool or wizard service
   must not be submitted to the Pebble Mobile App(s) by the operator of that
   service on behalf of other persons.

1. **4.5.** Do not post an app where the primary functionality is to: (a) drive
   affiliate traffic to a website; or (b) provide a view of a website not owned
   or administered by you (unless you have permission from the website
   owner/administrator to do so).

1. **4.6.** Do not send SMS, email or other messages on behalf of the user
   without providing the user with the ability to confirm content and intended
   recipient.

## 5. Promotion.

Products published on the Pebble Mobile App(s) may not directly or indirectly
engage in or benefit from the following behavior: (a) promotion via deceptive
ads on websites, apps or other properties, including simulated system, service
or app notifications or alerts; (b) promotion or install tactics that cause
redirection to the Pebble Mobile App(s) or the download of the app without
informed user action; or (c) unsolicited promotion via SMS services. It is your
responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to
direct users to pages that make your Products available for download.

## 6. Ad Policy.

The policy below covers all ads that are implemented in and bundled with
Products and apps. This policy is important in maintaining a positive experience
for everyone using the Pebble Platform. Be sure to check back from time to time,
as these policies may change.

1. **6.1.** **Developer Terms Apply to the Entire User Experience of Your
   Products and Apps.** Please be aware that Pebble's Developer Distribution
   Agreement and these Pebble Developer Program Policies (collectively, the
   **"Developer Terms"**) apply to each of your Products, as well as any ads or
   third-party libraries bundled or made available through such Products. Ads
   are considered part of your Products and apps for purposes of content review
   and compliance with the Developer Terms. Please take care to use advertising
   that does not violate the Developer Terms. Ads that are inconsistent with a
   Product's content rating also violate our Developer Terms.

1. **6.2.** **Ads Context.** Ads must not simulate or impersonate the user
   interface of any Products or notification and warning elements of an
   operating system. It must be clear to the user which Products or app each ad
   is associated with or implemented in.

1. **6.3.** **Ad Walls and Interstitial Ads.** Interstitial ads may only be
   displayed inside of the Products they came with. Forcing a user to click on
   ads or submit personal information for advertising purposes in order to fully
   use a Product is prohibited. A prominent and accessible target must be made
   available to users in any interstitial ad so they may dismiss the ad without
   penalty or inadvertent click-through.

1. **6.4.** **Interfering with Products and Third-Party Ads.** Ads associated
   with your Products must not interfere with other Products or their ads.

## 7. Policy Enforcement.

In the event that your Product is removed from the Pebble Mobile App(s), you
will receive an email notification to that effect. If you have any questions or
concerns regarding a removal, you may contact us at {{ site.url}}/contact/.
Serious or repeated violations of the Developer Terms will result in the
termination of your Developer Account. Repeated infringement of intellectual
property rights, including copyright, will also result in termination of your
Developer Account.
