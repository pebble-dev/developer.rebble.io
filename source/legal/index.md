To use the Pebble SDK, you must agree to the
[Pebble Terms of Use][terms_of_use] and the
[Pebble Developer License][developer_license] that our awesome lawyers have
put together to encourage the growth of the community while protecting you and
Pebble.

The [Terms of Use][terms_of_use] describe what your rights are when using Pebble
websites. The most important points for developers are:

* Any suggestions, feedback or comments shared on the forums can be used by
  Pebble.
* You retain ownership of the code that you push to CloudPebble.net.
* We are not responsible for loss of code on CloudPebble.net.
* You are responsible for making sure that you have the rights to all the assets
  (code, images, fonts, etc.) that you include in your applications.

The [Developer License][developer_license] covers the SDK and its components:

* You can use and re-distribute the SDK Examples.
* You can use and re-distribute the SDK re-distributable components (PebbleKit
  for iOS and Android).
* You may not redistribute the SDK as a whole.
* “Pebble” is a trademark and there are restrictions on how you can use this
  word in the name and description of your app. See the
  [Trademark Usage Guidelines][trademark_guidelines] for more details.
* If you are collecting user, device or location data, or any personally
  identifiable information, you must get the user consent first.
* Pebble may collect SDK usage information.

To distribute your applications on the Pebble appstore, you will also need to
read and agree to our [Pebble Distribution Agreement][distribution_agreement]
and the [Pebble Developer Program Policies][program_policies].

* The applications you submit on the Pebble appstore will not go through a
  review process but Pebble can take down your app at any time if it does not
  comply with the full agreement and the
  [Developer Program Policies][program_policies].
* If your app has been taken down and you believe that it should not have been
  removed please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact/).
* In case of repeated takedowns, Pebble can suspend and bar your Pebble
  developer account.
* You may not distribute apps designed to interfere, disrupt or damage the
  user’s Pebble or mobile device.
* You authorize Pebble to use your submission (app binary, screenshots, etc.) to
  promote Pebble in our marketing materials.

If you are interested in decompiling, reverse engineering and modifying the
firmware, you may only do so once you obtain a free firmware binary license from
us. Please contact our [developer support team](/contact/) to request a license.

This license will allow you to hack on the firmware and redistribute it but
will specifically exclude you from creating malware on our platform,
representing an unofficial firmware as official, selling a product with the
intent that end users install Pebble firmware on it, use our firmware to build
competing products, sell our firmware or derivatives, or install it on any non
Pebble hardware or emulator.
