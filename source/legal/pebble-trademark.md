## Official Guidelines

These guidelines are for Pebble licensees, authorized resellers, developers,
customers, and other parties wishing to use Pebble’s trademarks, service marks
or images in promotional, advertising, instructional, or reference materials, or
on their web sites, products, labels, or packaging.  Use of any Pebble logo for
commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Pebble may constitute
trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of federal and state
laws.  Use of Pebble trademarks may be prohibited, unless expressly authorized.

If you are a licensee of a Pebble trademark or logo and have been provided with
special trademark usage guidelines with your license agreement, please follow
those guidelines. If your license agreement does not provide usage guidelines,
then follow these guidelines. If you are a Pebble Authorized Reseller or member
of a Pebble program, you may be subject to additional restrictions.

Pebble’s trademarks, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are valuable
assets.  In following these guidelines, you help us protect our valuable
trademark rights and strengthen our corporate and brand identities.  By using a
Pebble trademark, in whole or in part, you are acknowledging that Pebble is the
sole owner of the trademark and promising that you will not interfere with
Pebble’s rights in the trademark, including challenging Pebble’s use,
registration of, or application to register such trademark, alone or in
combination with other words, anywhere in the world, and that you will not harm,
misuse, or bring into disrepute any Pebble trademark.  The goodwill derived from
using any part of a Pebble trademark exclusively inures to the benefit of and
belongs to Pebble. Except for the limited right to use as expressly permitted
under these Guidelines, no other rights of any kind are granted hereunder, by
implication or otherwise.  If you have any questions regarding these guidelines,
please talk to your Pebble representative or submit your query to Pebble’s
Trademark Department at legal@getpebble.com.

   terms that define the relationship authorized by their contract with Pebble.

   mark (but not a Pebble logo or other Pebble-owned graphic symbol) in a

### Rules for Proper Use of Pebble Trademarks

1. **1.** Trademarks are adjectives used to modify nouns; the noun is the
   generic name of a product or service.

1. **2.** As adjectives, trademarks may not be used in the plural or possessive
   form.

  Correct: I bought two Pebble smartwatches.

  Not Correct: I bought two Pebbles.

1. **3.** An appropriate generic term must appear after the trademark the first
   time it appears in a printed piece, and as often as is reasonable after that.

1. **4.** Always spell and capitalize Pebble’s trademarks in accordance with
   their registration.  Do not shorten or abbreviate Pebble product names.  Do
   not make up names that contain Pebble trademarks.

### Proper Trademark Notice and Attribution

1. **1.** **Distribution Within the United States Only:**

1. **1.1** On product, product documentation, or other product communications
   that will be distributed only in the United States, use the appropriate
   trademark symbol (TM, SM, ®) the first time the Pebble trademark appears in
   the text of the advertisement, brochure, or other material.
1. **1.2** Properly display the correct trademark symbol, spelling of the
   trademark, and generic term to use with the trademark.
1. **1.3** Include an attribution of Pebble’s ownership of its trademarks within
   the credit notice section of your product, product documentation, or other
   product communication. Following are the correct formats:

### Depictions of Pebble Products

1. **1.** **Endorsement or Sponsorship:** Pebble does not support the use of its
   logos, company names, product names, or images of Pebble products by other
   parties in marketing, promotional or advertising materials as their use may
   create the perception that Pebble endorses or sponsors the product, service
   or promotion.

1. **2.** **Compatibility:** If you are a developer, you may show an image of a
   Pebble product in your promotional/advertising materials to depict that your
   product is compatible with, or otherwise works with, the Pebble product or

1. **2.1** Your product is in fact compatible with, or otherwise works with, the
   referenced Pebble product.

   not an artist’s rendering (Note: You must obtain express written permission
   from Pebble before using any photograph owned or licensed by Pebble).

   context that reflects favorably on the Pebble products and on Pebble
   Technology Corp.
