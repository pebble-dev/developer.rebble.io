A plug and play custom status bar implementation for pebble apps and watch faces.
Easily populate 3 [text layers](``TextLayer``) and/or 5 [bitmap layers](``BitmapLayer``).

Use:

Choose a status bar height and icon size. Icons should be square with a maximum of 28 pixels.

```c
#define BAR_HEIGHT 20

#define ICON_WIDTH_HEIGHT 15
```

Declare

```c
static CustomStatusBarLayer *custom_status_bar;
```

Create

```c
custom_status_bar = custom_status_bar_layer_create(BAR_HEIGHT, GColorBlack, ICON_WIDTH_HEIGHT);
```

Set Text and Icons

Text layers, use positions CSB_TEXT_LEFT, CSB_TEXT_RIGHT, CSB_TEXT_CENTER

```c
char *t = ...;

custom_status_bar_layer_set_text(custom_status_bar, CSB_TEXT_LEFT, t);
```

Icons, use positions CSB_ICON_0 to CSB_ICON_4 (positions are left to right, 0 indexed)

```c
custom_status_bar_layer_set_bitmap(custom_status_bar, CSB_ICON_4, your_gbitmap); 
```

When you're done, destroy

```c
custom_status_bar_layer_destroy(custom_status_bar);
```

One last note! Your window should have a height of `168 - BAR_HEIGHT`.

See the header file for more details. Enjoy!
