Can you #MakeAwesomeHappen? Your app idea could win a Pebble and a trip to our

The XDA - Pebble Developer Challenge is a 3-week competition - your opportunity
to pitch your proposal for the best Pebble app and bring it to life with a
Pebble of your own. We'll be awarding Pebbles to the 20 best app proposals to
give even first time developers a chance to work on our platform. Of the 20
proposals that we select the best 3 Pebble apps created will be invited to
attend the 2014 Pebble Developer Retreat in October and we'll give them each a
Pebble Steel.
