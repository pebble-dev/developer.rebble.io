There was so much to pack into the last newsletter, we had to make a blog post 
about it!




## New Developer Site

![devsite](/images/blog/1112-devsite.png)

We've created a new [developer site](/) to make it much easier to use all the
resources available. Have a look around and try out the improved search feature,
which will show you all the blog posts, guides and documentation related to your
query.

As a bonus, we've also improved the Developer Guides and made it easier to find
all the great work by the Pebble community. We want submissions of events,
example apps, tools and libraries from YOU! Read the 
[submission instructions](/community/submission/) 
to get started.

## CloudPebble Improvements

![cp-locale](/images/blog/1112-cp-locale.png)

[CloudPebble]({{ site.links.cloudpebble }}) is now available in four languages!
Use the drop-down box at the bottom of the page to choose a language. We
currently support English, French, German and Spanish. This translation was
crowdsourced in less than a day with the help of a group of 
[awesome community members](https://github.com/pebble/cloudpebble/blob/master/translators.md)!

![cp-autocomplete](/images/blog/1112-cp-autocomplete.png)

CloudPebble also now includes fuzzy code completion, including your own symbols!
You can now type your code faster, and be made aware of any mistakes while you
type. You can also use this feature to see which SDK functions are available and
what arguments they require.

## Android App Beta Testing

![beta](/images/blog/1112-beta.png =400x)

We're beta testing a new version of the Pebble Android app, which you can help
us with by signing up to the 
[beta channel group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pebble-android-beta). 
We've re-written it from the ground up to be more stable and provide a much
better base for new features in the future. You can also now choose which
notifications you want to see on Pebble - from all your installed apps! If you
find any bugs, be sure to let us know using the Support option.

**Note that this version is required for use of CloudPebble features such as
installation and viewing app logs.**

## PebbleKit Android 2.6

We have also released a new version of PebbleKit Android that contains various
improvements and bug fixes. It is backward compatible with older versions in all
respects except for data logging, which is not backward compatible with versions
of the Pebble Android app before 2.1. You can get this version by updating your
build.gradle file in Android Studio to reference this version number, or
[download the new .jar file](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/content/com/getpebble/pebblekit/2.6.0/pebblekit-2.6.0-eclipse.jar) 
for use in Eclipse. The source code is available on the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/pebble/pebble-android-sdk).

## Awesome Community Links

Here are some of the things we've seen in the Pebble community recently. If you
see something you think should be included, let us know!
