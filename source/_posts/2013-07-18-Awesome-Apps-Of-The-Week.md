We love seeing what you guys are doing with the Pebble SDK! Every day there is more amazing apps that pushes the limit of what we thought was possible and contributes to [#makeawesomehappen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makeawesomehappen).

Here is a selection of the apps that caught our attention this week. Developers, please let us know about your apps in the forums or on twitter - And if you make a great video like most of the apps shown this week, it's even easier for us to help you!



## Pebble Rocker - Facebook, Twitter, Find your phone and more!

[Pebble Rocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smallrocksoftware.pebblerocker) by SmallRock Software is an amazing suite of apps for your phone and your watch. The list of features they managed to develop and release together is extremely impressive:

 * Browse your Facebook feed with comments and pictures
 * Check in with Foursquare to the nearest venues
 * Read your twitter timeline
 * Go through your phone's photos on the watch
 * And even a tip calculator and a phone pager!

Last but not least, they made it extremely easy to install the apps on your watch - just install the android app and follow the guides. At $.99 we think it's a great deal and we cant wait to see what extra features the updates will bring!

Not convinced yet? Check out this amazing video they made of the different apps:

Now if there is one more thing we would like to see here, it's an iPhone version! (Pebble Rocker is only available on Android right now).

## Pebble Canvas - Create new watchface from your phone

Most of you are probably familiar with [watchface-generator.de](http://http://www.watchface-generator.de/) to generate new watchface online without any coding. [Steve Penna](https://twitter.com/stevepenna) took that concept and wrote [Pebble Canvas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas) an Android application that allows you to create new watchfaces directly from your phone.

Not only can you create watchfaces, [Pebble Canvas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas) can also include dynamic information from your phone such as cell-coverage, battery status, unread emails, etc.

Pebble Canvas is [available for free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas) on the Android Play store.

## Synchronize your Pebble with Evernote

A few weeks ago [Evernote organized their annual DevCup](http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2013/05/13/evernotehonda-design-build-weekend/) and Pebble Team joined with some Pebbles and energy to help the teams interested in building a true multi-device experience.

Today we would like to feature two apps that were built for the cup and will come handy in a lot of situations - including "preparing for exams"(sic)!

[WatchNote](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/evernote-devcup-2013/hacks/watchnote
) lets you synchronize some notes between your phone, Evernote and your Pebble.

[Chronometry](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/evernote-devcup-2013/hacks/chronometry-simple-time-tracker
) helps you track your time, directly from Pebble and sends timesheets directly to your Evernote!
