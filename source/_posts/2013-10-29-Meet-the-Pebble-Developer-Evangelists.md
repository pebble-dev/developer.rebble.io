Hi Pebblers!

It’s been awhile since our last update to the developer’s blog, but we have some exciting news to share!

As many of you have probably noticed, the developer evangelism team here at Pebble has been growing over the last few months and we’re excited to introduce our newest additions!

[Thomas Sarlandie](http://www.sarfata.org/) joined Pebble in early July, traveling all the way from Senegal to be with us. Thomas grew up in France with a passion for computers and the Internet and prior to joining Pebble, co-founded and was CTO of Backelite, a leading french mobile development agency. He enjoys [writing books](http://www.amazon.fr/Programmation-Conception-publication-dapplications-iPhone/dp/2212136390), building robots, long distance amateur radio, hacking kernel drivers and doing security testing. When not in front of a computer, he sails, takes pictures and tries to understand Yoga. Some of you already met him at the August Pebble Developer Retreat, but if you didn’t, say hello to [@sarfata](https://twitter.com/sarfata)!

Cherie Williams joined Pebble in mid October. Her first exposure to programming happened at an early age when her dad handed her [Basic Computer Adventures](http://www.atariarchives.org/bca/). She went on to study Electrical Engineering in college, where she founded and led the UC Davis team that participated in the [DARPA Grand Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge). Her recent professional life has included lots of Ruby on Rails, working at HP Autonomy, and co-founding a startup. Cherie enjoys flying (PPL/IR), sailing, rock climbing, skiing, cycling and otherwise getting into as much trouble as possible. Say hello to [@cherie_williams](https://twitter.com/cherie_williams)!

The next few months promise to be exciting for both Pebblers and Pebble Developers alike and we hope you stay tuned to our developer blog (which we will be updating much more frequently) for the latest news.

We’d love to hear from you and help you out with all of your amazing projects, ideas, questions, issues, suggestions, and funny stories. [Contact us](/contact)!
