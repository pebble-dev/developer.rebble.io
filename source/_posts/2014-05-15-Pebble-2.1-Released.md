title: Pebble Updates, MakerFaire & MakingAwesomeHappen

Last week, we released both the 2.1 Pebble firmware, as well as the 2.1 Pebble 
SDK. Please make sure you have the latest version of the SDK (2.1.1) -- the 
latest update is available from the 
[developer site](/sdk/).



Some of the highlights of the new 2.1.1 firmware/SDK are:

* Pebble dynamic memory allocation has been improved and will now detect when
  you try to ``free()`` memory twice. With Pebble 2.1, your application will be
  killed and a message displayed in the console so you can detect and fix this
  problem, instead of potentially causing a memory corruption issue.
* You will need to update your Pebble to run apps built with the 2.1 SDK.
  Applications compiled with the 2.1 SDK will not appear in the menu and will
  not run on Pebble firmware 2.0.
* Notifications can be cleared via the Notification section in the Settings menu
* The `pebble screenshot` tool has been fixed and correctly generates 144x168
  screenshots

For a more comprehensive listing of changes included in 2.1.1, take a look at 
the official 
[release notes](/sdk/changelogs/2.1.1/)

##CloudPebble Updated with New Look & Features
CloudPebble saw an update to its look last week and is now easier to use than
ever! Some of the functional improvements to CloudPebble include:

* CloudPebble now lets you create applications using pure JavaScript with the
  [SimplyJS](http://simplyjs.io) library!
* You can now view the API documentation right in CloudPebble! Alt-click on any
  API function in your code for a pop-up explaining it. You can dismiss it by
  clicking or hitting esc. You can also view the pop-up for the name your editor
  cursor is in by pressing cmd-ctrl-shift-/ (Mac) or ctrl-alt-shift-/ (Windows).
  Short summaries now also appear at the bottom of the autocomplete popup.
* CloudPebble can now also import and open code created using GitHub’s handy
  [Gists](http://gist.github.com)
* iOS users can now more easily install apps on their phones by selecting it
  from a list! This requires iOS app 2.1.1. If you have 2.1.1 and your phone
  doesn't appear in the list, try killing and restarting the Pebble app
* A longstanding issue preventing iOS users from installing apps larger than 64k
  has been resolved in iOS app 2.1.1

##Pebble Devs #makeawesomehappen
We’d like to take the time to also share some great developer contributions to
the PebbleDev community:

* [Chris Lewis](https://twitter.com/Chris_DL) put together a terrific 
  [blog post](http://ninedof.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/linking-pebble-and-spark-core/) 
  on how to connect and integrate Pebble with the Spark core.
* The [HelloSwimIO](https://twitter.com/helloswimio) team wrote an informative 
  [blog post](http://helloswimio.tumblr.com/post/82087337072/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-pebble-development) 
  on how to setup SublimeText for development of Pebble apps.
* [James Brooks](https://twitter.com/jbrooksuk/) has also developed a useful 
  Sublime plugin for Pebble that is available on 
  [GitHub](https://github.com/jbrooksuk/Sublime-Pebble). Pebblers like 
  [Tyler Hoffman](http://tyhoffman.com) have already started to contribute to this open source project!
