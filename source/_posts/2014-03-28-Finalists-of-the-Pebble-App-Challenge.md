**UPDATE:** The next round of Pebble App Challenge voting—narrowing down our 16 finalists—has been postponed for now. We will update the voting schedule after [a recent issue with the iOS Pebble app](https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/12296/issue-pebble-ios-app-v2-1-updated-31-mar-crashing/p1) has been resolved.

The public has spoken! The Top16 finalists for the Pebble App Challenge have been selected!

If you were not selected this time, rest assured that we will have more opportunities to showcase your apps. We hope the visibility brought by the Challenge helped you get more downloads!
