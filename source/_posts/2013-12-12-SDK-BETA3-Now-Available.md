This holiday season is off to a great start and the Pebble community is getting larger every day! We wanted to take the time today to thank you all for your ongoing support and feedback on the Pebble SDK, and more importantly, for sticking with us through all of the bugs and issues. You are the most amazing people we could have to work with -- thanks!!!



Just a quick reminder: Pebble 2.0 will be released to all Pebble users soon. We announced the 2.0 SDK back in November, but you can still view the original [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoVX2ibCFXw&feature=youtu.be) ([or just the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/pebbledev/announcing-pebble-sdk-20)). Pebble 1.x applications are not compatible with this new major release. You will need to upgrade your apps to prepare for the 2.0 launch. However, as you go through the process of porting your apps, we're here to help you! Please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact) if you have any questions and we'd love to hear about when you complete your 2.0 apps. Please send us an email when you're done so we can help you share your Pebble app with Pebblers everywhere!

Today we are releasing an update to the 2.0 beta that fixes a lot of bugs and introduces a few new features. The full [release notes](/sdk/changelogs/2.0-BETA3) are available on our website, but the key changes in this version are:  
  * The iOS app fixes a number of data logging issues, along with the developer connection bug.  
  * The Android app fixes a large number of JS-related bugs.  
  * The Android app fixes a bug where all messages sent to Android would be automatically acknowledged. Your application should acknowledge its own app messages.  
  * Some new user features in the firmware, such as notification settings (do not disturb), and better alarms  
  * Lots of small UI and stability fixes in Pebble
