Today we're adding a new feature to [CloudPebble] that will make it easier than
ever to build your watchfaces and watchapps! The new UI Editor will let you
graphically build the user interface for your C app; you can then use the
generated C to build anything you like.

The UIs you build here can be exported from and imported to CloudPebble, and can
be used both in CloudPebble and with the native SDK.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with the UI Editor is to create a new, empty C
project in [CloudPebble].

To create your first window, click "Add New" next to "Source Files", select
"Window Layout", and name your new window:

![](/images/blog/ib-new-window.png)

This will create two new files, `your_window.c` and `your_window.h`. You will
build your user interface in `your_window.c`.

Click on the "Toolkit", then select some layers (e.g.
[`TextLayers`](``TextLayer``)) to add. You can drag these UI elements around on
the canvas and set proprties such as the text font or colour from the Properties
tab to the right. We recommend changing the auto-generated "Layer ID" fields to
something more obvious, as this is what the variables in the generated code will
be called.

When your UI is ready you can add functionality by clicking the pencil and ruler
on the far right of the window and adding code in and around the
`show_your_window` and `hide_your_window` functions. Note that you should not
change the code between the comments; nor should you change the comments
themselves.

When you want to display your window you will have to set up something to show
it â€” this is what the `show_your_window` function is for. Create a new C file
called `main.c` and fill it with something like this:

```c
#include <pebble.h>
#include "your_window.h"

int main() {
  show_your_window();
  app_event_loop();
  return 0;
}
```

Of course, you should always replace `your_window` in these examples with
whatever you called your window.

Make sure you have saved everything, then go ahead and build your project!

Going Further
-------------

Beyond simply displaying text, you can also upload fonts or black and white
images and use those, too. Just add them as resources as you usually would; they
will become available in the appropriate dropdowns for
[TextLayers](``TextLayer``), [BitmapLayers](``BitmapLayer``) and
[ActionBarLayers](``ActionBarLayer``)).

You can create multiple windows and register click handlers on those windows to
move between them; take a look at 
[our user interface guide](/guides/user-interfaces/) 
for details on how to do that. You can show new windows by
including the `some_window.h` file and calling the relevant `show_some_window`
function. Note, however, that  single window cannot be reused again in the
window stack.

If you want to add layers to your window that the UI editor does not support,
you can still use the editor for the rest of the UI; then add code to create the
extra elements in the `show_your_window` function.

And remember: this is just the first iteration! We plan to regularly enhance the
UI editor to expand its capabilities. We would appreciate your feedback! If you
