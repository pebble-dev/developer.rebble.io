Here's another newsletter blog post to keep you up-to-date on the Pebble
community happenings. This time we've got stories of success and tips on
expanding your app's audience!




## Get Ready For The World

Soon we will be supporting English, French, German, Spanish and Chinese, all of
which will allow time and date functions to produce information in a localized
form. Developers everywhere can begin to add localizations to their apps using
the [Internationalization API](``Internationalization``). What
does this mean for you? It means you can make your apps accessible to even more
users in even more countries!

To read more about localization, tips and tools for translating your apps be
sure to read the brand new 
[Translating Your Apps](/guides/tools-and-resources/internationalization/) guide!

## Pebble's First Hackathons in China!

In November Pebble sponsored two major hackathons in China. The first was 
[Hack Shanghai](http://www.hackshanghai.com/) with 250 of the top student 
developers in the country and the second was [THacks](http://www.thacks.org/), 
the first student-run hackathon at Tsinghua University in Bejing. Both
hackathons were 36 hours of intense hacking on Pebble and many other types of
hardware.

At Hack Shanghai the second place winner overall was FastReader: a Spritz speed
reader. The user can preset certain reading material categories through the
cellphone and then Pebble flashes the important words. If the user finds the
reading material interesting, then the user can read the full article off the
cell phone.

Another cool Pebble app was Active Social Matching. Users can preset the
characteristics of people they'd like to meet. If two users are physically
nearby and with >80% matching characteristics, then the watch will vibrate. The
users then can decide from preset messages on the watch if they want to meet
with each other or not.

There were a lot of other amazing projects that came out of the event and we're
looking forward to seeing more types of global applications in many languages as
we come to a hackathon near you!

## Pebble London's First Meetup Was a Hit

On the 27th of November we [hosted a meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleLDN/) 
for London based Pebble developers at Innovation Warehouse, and you guys didn't
disappoint! Apart from the special guest appearances from
[SwimIO](http://www.swimiomotion.com/), we had over 40 Pebblers attend for food,
networking and a generally awesome time.

We also had flash talks from anyone who wanted to express themselves, and were
subsequently entertained by Jens Elstner for [Keepzer](https://www.keepzer.com/), 
Tim Williams for [what3words](http://what3words.com/) and Nick Jackson for 
[Pebble Bike](http://www.pebblebike.com/).

Didn't make it? Don't fret! We will be continuing to host meetups in London and
other places in the coming weeks and months, so join our 
[Pebble London Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleLDN/) to be notified of 
upcoming events!

## Pebble SF Returns with Holiday Workshop 

This coming Thursday December 11th, we will once again be taking over the space
at Atlassian in San Francisco, and you're invited! If you're in the area be sure
to [sign up on the meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleSF/events/219036473/), 
and come along for our workshop on how to build your first Pebble watchface! You 
can buy Pebbles for loved ones as gifts and create a picture scrolling watchface 
just for them!

Here are some pictures from last month's meetup. If you can't make it this time
we host them in SF every month and plan to expand rapidly in more locations!
