## Appstore Launch Pebble Steel Winners

We're pleased to announce the winners of the Pebble Appstore launch prizes for the four categories described in [our January blog post](/blog/2014/01/06/Pebble-appstore/).

### Prize #1: All Watch Apps & Faces

We randomly selected an app that was available at the time of the Pebble appstore launch on February 4th. This prize goes to [BITCOIN WATCHER](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52db0b8d889f5d8253000313), which was developed and submitted by Gh0st Development. [BITCOIN WATCHER](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52db0b8d889f5d8253000313) helps you keep track of the current Bitcoin price across several large trades.

### Prize #2: Apps using PebbleKit JS

We randomly selected an app that made use of the new PebbleKit JS API's. This prize goes to [Rapid T & W](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52b57d30b6d9ae1a76000016), which was developed and submitted by Luca Infante. Rapid T & W displays the time, date and battery with a quick flick of the wrist in the Y axis. With a quick movement on the Z axis, get the weather information. With a quick movement on the X axis, see the stats of accelerometer tap event.

### Prize #3: Apps Ported from 1.x to 2.0

We randomly selected an app that was ported from an app created using the Pebble 1.0 SDK to the new Pebble 2.0. This prize goes to [Interval Trainer](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52dccaa419ed61877c000074), which was developed and submitted by SetPebble. Interval Trainer tracks elapsed time and interval times. A vibration alerts you when an interval changes, and the numbers are big for easy reading while exercising.

### Prize #4: Best Bug Report on the Developer Forums

Our prize for the [best bug report on the developer forums](https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/10343/ios-bugreport-beta6-try-turning-it-off-and-on-again) was chosen by one of our iOS engineers for its completeness, which helped in tracking down a major 2.0 bug. This bug report is a fantastic example of what we expect from developers that are reporting bugs, and we highly recommend all developers review this example to help improve the time it takes to resolve any bugs or issues. Martin Norland, the winner, found this bug while developing his watchface [Timely](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52978a53bbd0862701000002), which is also available on the Pebble appstore.

All the winners have been contacted and their Pebble Steel are on the way!
