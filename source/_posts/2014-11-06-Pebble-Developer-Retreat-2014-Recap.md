Can you believe it's already been a month since the developer retreat? This blog post is long overdue but it was waiting for some very important content so that I could share some highlights from the retreat! I asked the retreat attendees what their favorite presentations/parts of the retreat were and I think these represent some of the best. If you don't agree, then tell me in the comments!

Check out the [full developer retreat recap](/community/events/developer-retreat-2014/) broken down day by day in the community section of our new developer website!  We're still working on a video montage of the robotics competition so that should be on the website soon! For even more detail on what this awesome group of 100 developers from around the world got up to check out our [full schedule](/community/events/developer-retreat-2014/detailed-schedule/).





## Retreat Highlights

###Advanced Techniques: Graphics
Heiko Behrens and Matthew Hungerford talk about advanced programming techniques for Pebble. This was a series of three presentations wrapped up into one but the videos are in three parts. This talk focused on graphics techniques including run-time dithering, offline dithering, pixel manipulations, and frame-buffer drawing.
  
This talk featured the amiga boing ball dithering demo.
