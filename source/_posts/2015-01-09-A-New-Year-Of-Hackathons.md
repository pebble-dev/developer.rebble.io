It's a brand new year, which for developers and hackers can mean only one thing -
a new year of hackathons! Throughout January and beyond, Pebble will be making
appearances at various events (large and small) so if you spot an event near
you, be sure to come along. We will be giving away Pebble swag and selling
refurbished Pebbles for $50, and will also be on hand to answer any questions
you have as well as help you create the best hacks on Pebble. We saw some
awesome apps and hacks arise from hackathons in 2014, but we think the best is
yet to come!

See below for details on the most immediate dates, or the Pebble Developers
website [Events page](/community/events) for all our plans for future events. If
you are organizing a hacking event that we could attend, be sure to 
[get in touch](/contact/).





## Awesome Community Links

  [found an interesting way](https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/19365/android-tasker-app-manager-for-pebble-install-uninstall-pebble-apps-via-tasker) to
