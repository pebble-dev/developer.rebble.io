Space Apps 2014 is taking place this weekend (April 12th/13th) and we are very happy to be a partner of this event. This year, the challenges [include a Wearable category](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/space-wearables-fashion-designer-astronauts/) but we do not doubt that Pebble will find its way in a lot of the other challenges as well!



Pebble is sponsoring four locations this year and we hope to expand this even more in the future. Pebble loaner units are available in:

 - [Space Apps Reno](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/location/reno/)
 - [Space Apps Toronto](http://spaceappstoronto.com/)
 - [Space Apps New York](http://spaceappsnyc.com/)
 - [Space Apps San Francisco](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/location/constant-contact/)

## Getting Started for Space Apps 2014

If you are just getting started with Pebble during Space Apps 2014, here are some very useful resources to get your first apps running in minutes:

 - Our [Introduction to Pebble development video](/blog/2014/03/27/Introduction-to-Pebble-development/) will show you how to create a Pebble project using our online IDE [CloudPebble]({{ site.links.cloudpebble }}) and how to deploy your first app to a Pebble

 - Our [Build a Watchface video](/blog/2014/03/28/Build-a-Watchface/) explains the basic concepts of Pebble user interface and how to build a new watchface. If you want to build a watchface that displays the local time on Pluto, it's exactly what you need!

 - [SimplyJS.io](http://simplyjs.io) is a framework to build Pebble apps completely in JavaScript. It is also included in [CloudPebble]({{site.links.cloudpebble}}) (just choose the "Simply.js" project type when creating a new project). If your data is available in a web service and you just want to display it on a Pebble screen, this is a great way to do it!

 - Our [official examples]({{site.links.examples_org}}) and the [not-so-official examples](https://github.com/pebble-hacks) both include lots of cool things: [how to use the GPS and make HTTP requests]({{site.links.examples_org}}/pebblekit-js-weather), and [transfer images from the Internet to Pebble](https://github.com/pebble-examples/pebble-faces), etc.

## Pebble and Space

Looking for inspiration? There are already some great Pebble apps for Space-fans:

  * [Pebble Mars](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52cfaf1ef726c833ac000049/) ([source code](https://github.com/witoff/PebbleMars)) displays (almost) realtime pictures from Curiosity, as well as the current time on Mars.

  * [Pebble Sat](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52d396683e2e256b6c00001e/) ([source code](https://github.com/sarfata/pbsat)) automatically calculates and display the time of the next ISS pass over your current location. When the ISS is flying over, it also shows you where to look to spot it!

## Getting Help

If you need help, we would like to recommend a few channels to quickly get answers:

 - The #pebble IRC channel on irc.freenode.net - A lot of experienced Pebblers hang out on this channel and this is a great place to meet other Space Apps Challengers during the week-end.
 - Visit the [Pebble Developer Forums](https://forums.getpebble.com/categories/developer-discussion). They are also extremely active and already have answers to all the usual questions.
 - Contact us on [@pebbledev](https://twitter.com/pebbledev) - Most of our developer evangelism team is in Illinois this week-end for [HackIllinois](http://www.hackillinois.org) - Pinging us on twitter is a great way to get our attention.

## Tell us about your projects!

We would love to feature all the projects that will be built this year! [Contact us](/contact) and we will include you in a future retrospective of all the Space Apps - Pebble projects.
