Busy times for the Pebble elves! Beta3 last week, [the app store announcement](/blog/2013/12/18/all-aboard-the-pebble-app-store/) on wednesday and now a new BETA! [Pebble SDK BETA4 is available on our website now](/sdk/download). Existing iOS developers will receive an email with a link to install it; if you are not on that list yet, please [fill the form](https://docs.google.com/a/pulse-dev.net/forms/d/14r3MHPsdH5ha-BCkfuquQuAKuQSEJLmxm--XXpBA8mg/viewform) to request it.



This version gets us even closer to an official 2.0 release with more fixes and improvements on the SDK and the mobile apps:

 * Fixed a problem where the iOS app would get killed after a few minutes in the background
 * Lots of DataLogging fix on the firmware and on Android
 * Added timestamps on accelerometer samples
 * Improved errors handling for PebbleKit JS apps on iOS and Android
 * [Read the full Changelog / Release Notes](/sdk/changelogs/2.0-BETA4)

Pebble 1.x apps are not compatible with Pebble SDK 2.0 - but **if you upload a 2.0 build of your application, we will automatically upgrade your users to the new version**. To take advantage of this, you just need to submit your application in the [Pebble appstore](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/) and add the Name and UUID of your 1.x apps.

We've also got a special treat for our designer friends! Today we're adding a new document to the Pebble library, the [Pebble UX Design Guide](/guides/design-and-interaction/). This guide is written for designers and soon-to-be-designers of Pebble apps who want to create a cohesive user experience that works with the latest Pebble SDK functionality.

As always, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact) if you have any questions.


We wish you a very pleasant time with family and friends - And please, please, please, **upload your apps to the Pebble appstore!**.
