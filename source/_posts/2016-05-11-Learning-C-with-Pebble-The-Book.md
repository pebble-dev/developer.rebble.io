*This is a guest blog post from Mike Jipping, professor of Computer Science at
Hope College (Michigan, USA), who has been writing an open source book which
teaches the C programming language using Pebble smartwatches.*

If you want to learn to program using the C programming language, you have lots
of choices. C has been around a while, so there are many textbooks and lots of
Web sites that have information on the language. Most are very general, with
examples and projects that you could run on any general purpose computer. Very
few are tailored to embedded systems and none are targeted at smartwatches,
until now, that is.


Pebble has teamed up with a college professor and a group of Pebble community
developers to produce [Learning C with Pebble](http://pbl.io/cbook), an online,
open source textbook that teaches C with examples and projects focused on
Pebble smartwatches.

In order to build apps for Pebble smartwatches, a developer needs to program in
one of two languages: JavaScript or C. Of the two, you might choose JavaScript
for some familiar features, but C might be the better choice since it produces
apps that run more efficiently and perform with better speed than those written
in JavaScript.

The book is a textbook: it teaches how to program using the C programming
language. But it is very unique among textbooks.

* It is free, online, and open source. You can have your own copy for free.
You can read it online or download the PDF or ePub versions.
* It is written with Markdown formatting. This means you can fork the book's
source, edit it or add new content in Markdown, and submit a pull request to
have your changes added to the book.
* It represents a work in progress. The online version will be updated to
reflect error corrections and new content. Sections of the book will be
released in intervals.

In addition to these unique features, *Learning C with Pebble* comes with
Project Exercises at the end of each chapter. Lots of C books include questions
or small exercises to work on with each chapter. This book has "project"
exercises: complete Pebble smartwatch applications that give you code to start,
ask you to make changes, and give you a solution so you can compare your answer
to others. It encourages you to work in focused code that runs on a Pebble and
helps you learn C in an environment that is targeted to Pebble programming.

In addition to learning the topics in each chapter, these Project Exercises help
you learn the Pebble programming system and the scaffolding that apps for Pebble
need to run.  You learn Pebble code in a way that helps you to become
comfortable with the runtime environment and with unfamiliar code.  And you
learn C along the way.

This book is written by Mike Jipping, a professor of Computer Science at Hope
College in Holland, Michigan, USA.  Mike has been writing apps for handheld
computers, smartphones, and wearable devices for over 30 years. He has developed
several apps for Pebble smartwatches. The Pebble community developers who are
helping out with the book are [Allan Findlay](https://twitter.com/allanf175),
[Paul Niven](https://twitter.com/NiVZ), [Mathew
Reiss](https://twitter.com/mydogsnowy), [David Rodriguez
Rincon](https://twitter.com/dabdemon), and [Rob
Spiess](https://twitter.com/robisodd). Everyone is active in the Pebble
developer community, in the forums, and on Slack.

The book can be found at http://pbl.io/cbook. The first 8 chapters have been
released with the remainder of the book will be coming out over the coming
summer. This is a readable book, packed with examples and code and projects.
It's a great way to learn the C programming language on Pebble smartwatches.
