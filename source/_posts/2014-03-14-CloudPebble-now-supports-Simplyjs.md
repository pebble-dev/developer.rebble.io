It's now even easier to get started with Pebble development or prototype new ideas!

CloudPebble recently gained support for building Simply.js projects â€“ which means you
can now write, build and install simple apps entirely in JavaScript and inside your
web browser.



To get started, [head to CloudPebble]({{site.links.cloudpebble}}) and create a Simply.js
project:

![Create Simply.js project](/images/blog/cloudpebble-simplyjs-create.png)

Once you've created the project you will be presented with a project containing a single
file, `app.js`. This file will contain the standard Simply.js demo program, which demonstrates
reacting to button clicks and accelerometer events. You can modify this script to contain
anything you like; you can find some documentation and examples on the
[Simply.js website](http://simplyjs.io/). We'll handily highlight lines with syntax errors as you
type your code.

Once you've written your app, you can easily get it on your watch. Head to the compilation
page and hit the blue Run build button. In a couple
of seconds you'll be able to install your new app!

Make sure you have Wi-Fi enabled on your phone, enable developer mode, and enter the IP the app
presents into the box. Then just hit Install & Run and
you're set! Each time you change your Javascript code, you'll need to save the file, build it, and install.

Once your app is installed, you can use the View app logs button
to view any output from your `console.log` statements.

And behold! Your own app, entirely in JavaScript:

You can install as many of these CloudPebble/Simply.js apps as you can fit on your watch. Have fun!
