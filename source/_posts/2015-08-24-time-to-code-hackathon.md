*This is a guest post by Matt Langlois, developer of the Pebble
[Meetup](/blog/2015/06/12/timeline-challenge-week-six/) app, contributor to 
pebble.js, and active Pebble developer.*

The 
[Time to Code](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleOTT/events/222726467/) hackathon in 
Ottawa, Canada on July 11th and 12th was a huge success! We had developers from 
all over the city come and join us to create their first app. We even had a 
developer who had never touched code before join us to create his first app ever!





**Schedule**

Saturday started off with a wonderful presentation by Cherie from Pebble’s 
California HQ teaching people how to create their 
[first watchface](https://github.com/cjwilliams/watchface-demo). The 
presentation was spot on, and she even had a shout out to my Meetup app when she 
was discussing the timeline. The rest of the day was spent 
creating apps and turning coffee and snacks into code. 

The second day we let the developers work on their projects all day. Jonathan, 
the creator of Music Boss and Ottawa’s Pebble Rockstar, also stopped by on 
Sunday to speak with the developers and check out some of the creations. In the 
afternoon developers had a chance to present their hacks and creations to the 
panel of judges. 

**Winners**

Some pretty amazing ideas became a reality at this event. Here's a rundown of 
our winners:

Kurt (MetaDark) created his first ever app for the Pebble platform this weekend. 
He designed a game called
[circle attack](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55a3377ec643f9989b00008d).
His app makes use of plenty of API functionality such as: colors, animations, button events, 
and randomization. I had a chance to speak with the developer and it sounds like he 
really thought his app through by optimizing it in every way possible to 
use up as little resources as possible making it run just as well for Aplite. 
He was the winner of a Pebble Time.

Jaime took his first shot at Javascipt using PebbleJS to create his food truck 
app. Check out the source [here](https://github.com/jaimeyu/foodtruck-pebble). 
His app is more of a utilitarian app providing a list, sorted by distance, of 
the nearest food trucks. For his app, Jaime won a Pebble Steel.

Alex was the creator of a watchface known as SpringPebble. It was one of the few 
watchfaces created during the event and the judges really liked it. It made use 
of animations and colours in a harmonizing way. For his watchface Alex won an 
Original Pebble.

Finally, we decided to choose Joseph as a runner up - he made a 5 pin bowling 
app. This app had a very fluid user experience but was unfortunately not fully 
complete, hence the reason he was the runner up.

Other than the above listed winners we also had some other pretty creative ideas! 
A group of 3 friends created a way to input text using only gestures. Another 
developer created a way to setup a home location so you will never miss the bus 
at that stop! There were also some games and other watchfaces created which I 
haven’t seen on the Pebble before. 

**Looking Forward**

Hopefully, the development doesn’t stop here for these Pebblers. I look forward 
to seeing further refined versions of their apps on the Pebble appstore. 

What a great event - I hope I am able to run an event like this in the future!
