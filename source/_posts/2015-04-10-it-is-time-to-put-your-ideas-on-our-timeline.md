For the past few weeks, we’ve been releasing updated elements of our new SDK.
As many of you know, one of the most important facets of the Pebble Time is the
**Pebble timeline**.

The timeline is a core feature of the Pebble Time that allows users to see
important events in their past, present, and future. The timeline creates a
unique opportunity for both Pebblers and developers. Not only can users simplify
their lives by tracking the important events in their days, but developers can
also create applications that push pins directly to their users’ Pebbles. 



## Great Uses of Timeline

Timeline was envisioned to be a truly personal experience for users: they have
the power to determine exactly what content goes on their timeline. Here are
some potential ways Pebblers can use their timeline:

- A mom can track her child’s flight itinerary.
- A swimmer can check the times of all his races for the day.
- A doctor can see which meetings she missed during her last surgery.
- A student can check when he next has to take his medicine.
- A tailgator can keep track of their favourite sports teams.

The possibilities are endless, which is why we now want to turn to our amazing,
creative community to see what you all can create. There are so many
applications that we would love to see materialize, and the ideas below are
barely the tip of the iceberg. 

- Sports tracking: upcoming matches, live scores, notifications on goals, etc
- Transit (Bus/Train/Subway/other) times for your city
- Reminder services and integration with to-do list applications
- TV reminders: being able to select your favorites so that you’ll be notified
  when the program will air. 
- Flight status trackers
- Weather alerts: snow alert/ice alert/pollen alerts/extreme weather notifications 
- Payment reminders 
- Coupon/discount notifications 
- Software/website performance notifications 

## How to Get Started With Timeline

These apps and others like them would be widely used, and we encourage you to
start developing. For a detailed tutorial on how to write your first timeline
application, check out this 
[blog post](/blog/2015/03/20/Getting-Started-With-Timeline/). You can also
peruse our [timeline guides](/guides/pebble-timeline/), as well as a few open 
source examples such as 
[Hello Timeline]({{site.links.examples_org}}/hello-timeline) and 
[Timeline TV Tracker]({{site.links.examples_org}}/timeline-tv-tracker). 

If you’d like some extra guidance before jumping in and developing your own app,
you’re in luck! Our next [meetup](http://pebble.meetup.com/), which is on April
23rd in San Francisco, will be focused exclusively on timeline. We’ll be giving
live demos on how to create timeline apps, how to utilize timeline pin actions,
and more. If you can’t join us in person, watch the livestream of the event
virtually! Follow [@PebbleDev](http://twitter.com/PebbleDev) on Twitter or watch
the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleSF/events/221717043/) for the link
when it goes live.

If all the exciting features and possibilities mentioned above weren’t enough to
inspire you to write timeline apps for the rest of your life, today we are also
teasing our **Timeline Challenge**. The Timeline Challenge will be a
competition to see who can create the most innovative, exciting Pebble
applications that use the timeline: winners will receive Pebble Times, awesome
swag and exclusive opportunities. Look out for more details coming next Tuesday,
April 14th!
