Hi Pebblers!

We had a blast at the first open lab that we hosting at Pebble HQ last Friday. We know many of you were interested in joining, but perhaps you don't live in the area, or you just weren't able to make it; to help with this, we're now announcing our first Virtual Lab for Pebble Developers! This is a great opportunity for you to hack on your latest projects and receive help from our developer evangelists, Thomas and Cherie, in an online setting.

#####TIME  
3PM-6PM PST  
#####PLACE  
irc.freenode.net #pebble (we'll move into a Hangout if we find we need to)
