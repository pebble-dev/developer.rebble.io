We've had a pretty awesome start to 2014 and we couldn't have done it without you! First, we kicked off the year by sponsoring the wildly successful [AT&T Developer Summit hackathon](https://devsummit.att.com/), which was followed shortly after by our announcement of the new [Pebble Steel]({{ site.links.pebble }}/steel) during [CES](https://www.cesweb.org/). In addition, we announced that 2.0 will be publicly released along with the Pebble appstore at the end of January. Here's a sneak peek of what the appstore will look like.

Have you [submitted your Pebble app](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/) yet?

To prepare for the 2.0/appstore launch, we're releasing BETA5, an update that will make your apps run better than ever and will fix a lot of bugs that you've reported to us!

This version brings us critical fixes and improvements to the SDK and mobile apps:


*	Fixed Android data logging bugs where data would get duplicated
*	Merged data logging fixes for iOS that were supposed to be in BETA4 (sorry!)
* Added an end of session message on Android data logging
* Fixed accelerometer bugs where the accelerometer would stop sending data
* Changed the animation when switching from one watchface to the next
* ...and more! [Read the Full Changelog / Release Notes](/sdk/changelogs/2.0-BETA5)

Pebble 1.x apps are not compatible with Pebble SDK 2.0, but if you upload a 2.0 build of your application, we will automatically upgrade your users to the new version. To take advantage of this, you just need to submit your app to the [Pebble appstore](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/) and add the Name and UUID of your 1.x apps.
