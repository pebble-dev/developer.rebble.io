Hi Pebblers!

It's no secret that we've been hard at work developing better software for Pebble and this Wednesday, November 6th, we'll be making a very important announcement. You're invited to join our livestream event at 10AM PST to hear what awesome new things we've been working on to make Pebble a more robust and feature-rich platform. To tune in, visit [https://www.getpebble.com](https://www.getpebble.com) on Wednesday morning after 9AM PST to obtain a link for the livestream. After the live broadcast hosted by Eric and our very own [Thomas](https://www.twitter.com/sarfata), we will be leading a Reddit AMA discussion at noon (12PM PST) to answer any lingering questions you may have.



###Introducing Open Labs!###
Over the last couple of weeks, we've been working on ways to better serve the Pebble developer community as an evangelist team, and we're happy to announce that we are hosting our very first Open Lab for Pebble Developers on Friday, December 6th. We're excited to invite you to come visit us at Pebble HQ for 3 hours of intense Pebble hacking and troubleshooting. For this first event, we want to make sure we can work with everyone that attends, so we've limited attendance to 10 developers; however, if you're not able to make it for whatever reason, have no fear! This is going to be a weekly event (we just love you guys too much to do this only once!)
