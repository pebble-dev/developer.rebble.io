Hey Pebble Devs!

It's been a great year for us at Pebble as well as all the awesome community
developers that come up with ever more surprising and useful apps for Pebble.
We would not be [where we are today with over 5000 apps without all the hard
work that you guys put into your
apps](http://www.fastcompany.com/3040235/app-economy/pebble-passes-5000-smartwatch-apps-how-it-got-there-and-what-comes-next),
so **thank you**!

We look forward to another amazing year with you in 2015, May your hands always be busy!

## Happy New Year!

As we enter 2015, we took some time to recap all that we have seen, done and
achieved in 2014 in the Pebble Developer Community. The list is extensive, but
here are a few of our favorite bits:

* [Launch of Pebble SDK 2.0](/blog/2014/02/03/Pebble-appstore-is-live/), which
  introduced PebbleKit JS and allowed all kinds of apps for connecting to the
  web, or using GPS for navigation.

* [CloudPebble]({{site.links.cloudpebble}}) went official as the recommended
  web-based Pebble IDE. Since then Katharine has been busy adding many advanced
  features such as code completion, a UI editor and GitHub integration to make
  it easier than ever to get creating for Pebble.

* We continued to expand the capabilities of Pebbles (old and new!) with new
  [Compass](/guides/events-and-services/compass/), 
  [Background Workers](/blog/2014/09/30/SDK-2.6-Meetup-More) and 
  [Wakeup APIs](/guides/events-and-services/wakeups/) to allow apps to work in
  more relevant and timely ways.

* We hosted the [2014 Pebble Developer
  Retreat](/community/events/developer-retreat-2014/) to bring together the top
  community members for hacking, bonding and innovation on the Pebble platform.
  Also, who could forget that robot competition?

* Pebble [went international](/guides/tools-and-resources/internationalization/)! 
  With notifications in 80 languages supported as well as translating the watch
  firmware to three additional languages, users can experience awesome Pebble
  apps in more languages and regions than ever before.

* Pebble Meetups are popping up around the world. So far the [San
  Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleSF/),
  [London](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleLDN/) and
  [Paris](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleFR/) groups have launched. We would love
  to help you start a group in your own city, [contact us for
  help!](/community/events/)

## Pebble Emulator Preview

![qemu](/images/blog/020115-qemu.png)

The Pebble Emulator is almost here, and to celebrate we gave away a version you
can try via the
[QEMU 2014 Advent Calendar](http://blog.vmsplice.net/2014/12/qemu-advent-calendar-2014-retrospective.html?m=1).
This package is limited to the pre-compiled apps, but includes a number of demo
apps for you to play around with.

You will eventually be able to build and test with this emulator, which is great
news for budding developers who do not yet own a Pebble!


## Awesome Community Links

Here are some of the things we've seen in the Pebble community recently. If you
see something you think should be included, let us know!

* Pebble can now use the power of
  [WolframAlpha](http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/406359) thanks to the
  awesome app created by Arnoud Buzing. With this app you can use your watch to
  access features of the Wolfram Cloud such as financial data, geolocation and
  weather information.

* Pebble Developer Edwin Finch has
  [created a playlist of videos](https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/19027/pebble-development-tutorial-series-on-youtube-by-edwin-finch#latest)
  aimed at helping new developers get into making apps for the Pebble platform.
  If you prefer your instruction in video format, be sure to have a look!

* [First Pebble Meetup in
  Paris](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleFR/events/219256327/) on Tuesday January
  6th!
