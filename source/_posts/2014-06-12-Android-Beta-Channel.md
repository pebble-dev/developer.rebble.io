*And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards the Play
Store to be born?*

Sign up for the Pebble Android
[Beta Channel](https://groups.google.com/group/pebble-android-beta) to find out!

New Pebble Android releases will be made available to beta testers on this
channel.
Once you have joined the Google Group, you will need to
[opt-in](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.getpebble.android).
Once signed up and opted-in, you will receive beta versions of the Pebble

There may be a delay before Google Play transitions you from the release channel
to the beta channel.
