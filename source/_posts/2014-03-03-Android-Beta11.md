Android Beta 11 was just released. This version is a huge improvement to BETA10, it fixes the most annoying bugs in BETA10 but also improves stability considerably.



Changed in this version:

* PebbleKit JS localStorage is now sandboxed for each app
* Many improvements to onboarding and FW installation
* Issues with sideloading apps in some circumstances have been fixed
* Some issues with loading JS configuration views after the app has been quit have been addressed
* JavaScript app logs printed via ADB are cleaner
* MyPebble now loads faster

Known issue:

* Pairing a Pebble during onboarding may not succeed.  If you run into problems, exit the Pebble app.  Remove the pairing entry from Android BT settings & your Pebble.  Then pair manually using BT settings.

Please report problems and bugs in [the forums](https://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/11651/pebble-2-0-android-beta11-feedback).

Have a great day!
