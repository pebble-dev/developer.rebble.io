If you have been following Pebble in the news, you have likely seen that there have been some recent changes to the Pebble Team. We wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the #awesome work that has gone into getting our developer program to where it is today, and introduce you to the (somewhat) new faces of Pebble's Developer Relations team!

<p class="blog__image-text">The 2015 Developer Retreat - Bringing the Pebble Dev Team together with the Pebble Community!</p>

The Developer Relations team is responsible for overseeing Pebble's developer program, managing documentation and events, listening to and advocating for our community's needs, and creating a safe, welcoming and empowered community of Pebble developers. It's a big job - and we are incredibly lucky and grateful to be able to continue the work of the brilliant and compassionate team that came before us!

And now to introduce you to the (somewhat) new faces of Developer Relation: Cat and Jon!

Cat Haines joined Pebble in October 2015, and has been helping with a lot of the behind the scenes work for Pebble's Developer Relations team. Cat enjoys tinkering with hardware and JavaScript (so naturally she's excited about [Rocky](https://github.com/pebble/rockyjs)), crafting, and trying her best to keep a variety of house plants alive. You can follow her antics on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_cathaines), [GitHub](https://github.com/cat-haines), and her [personal blog](http://cathaines.com).

Jon Barlow joined Pebble in September 2015. He is a champion Kickstarter backer and has been a longstanding community member and forum moderator. You may remember him from such apps as [91 Dub](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/52b231c2b70e1c159500009b) and [The Day Today](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55a4b474e6f909512b0000a5). Jon has spent many years volunteering and helping people within the Pebble community and is looking forward to continuing this role as his day job. Jon works for Pebble remotely from the UK and you can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/orviwan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/orviwan).

We have some exciting updates in the works - including introductions to some of the other well know (and loved) developer facing teams at Pebble. We can't wait to share what's coming up - so stay tuned, and if you have any questions, you can always find Cat (@cat) or Jon (@orviwan) on Pebble's Slack channel.

Happy Hacking!
