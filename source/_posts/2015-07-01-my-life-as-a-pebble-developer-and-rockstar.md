April 2012 seems like such a long time ago. My first born is three years older,
and now has a younger sibling. It also means that it has been three years since
I contributed to the original Kickstarter campaign for Pebble. I was in the
first batch of backers and received my Black Pebble early February 2013.
This was the beginning of something special for me.





After being introduced to my first computer when I was about 10 years old in
elementary school, I’ve had an interest in computers and technology that has
continued past my graduation from Computer Systems Engineering (Carleton University)
in June 2007. A watch that connected to my phone that could do ...anything...
was something I could only dream about. The funny thing is when I received my
Pebble, I wasn't even developing; I hadn't touched a line of code between graduation
and receiving my Pebble. Having the Pebble on my wrist changed something: the
flow of ideas began, I greased my mental cogs, and started up the development machine.

In the beginning, Pebble Development was an independent thing (for me anyways),
it was still pretty new, and wasn't as well documented as it is now. But the
community of developers for this platform grew quickly and superstars like
Katharine Berry were pumping out open source examples for noobs like me to refer
to. My first app, Simply Alarm, was my first crack at Android and Pebble development.
The first version didn't even have a Pebble watch app, it just sent notifications
to the Pebble when alarms rang. My second app, Music Boss, was born the way many
great ideas are: while having a beer. I wanted to adjust the music volume on my
phone while it was plugged into the sound system. I looked at my wife and swore:
"When I get home, I am making an app that lets me adjust music volume with this
thing [pointing at my Pebble]." This original idea for the application expanded
greatly once I started developing.

When I got my invitation to attend the first Pebble Developer Retreat in August
2013, I couldn't believe that I had been chosen. It was surreal: I was just an
indie developer with a couple of apps from Ottawa, Ontario. I'll never forget
the first time I met Eric; he joined us at a bar near our hotel the night before
the opening day of the retreat. He showed me his Pebble with Music Boss running
on it and asked me "Does it really have to say 'music volume' above the volume
bar?" My conversation with Eric about how my app could be improved, in addition
to his offer to get other Pebble Developers to help, was one of my most memorable
Pebble development moments. Finally meeting all the developers and Pebble employees
I had been chatting with for months before the retreat really made me feel like I
was part of a community.

The year following the 2013 Retreat was a busy one full of Pebble Firmware updates
during the Pebble 2.0 rollout and app updates from developers. The
[2014 Developer Retreat](/community/events/developer-retreat-2014/)
was approaching and I was so excited to get the chance to attend. It was amazing to
return to see Pebble friends I had made the previous year, make new ones, and catch
up with community developers old and new. It was at this retreat that I met Kat, the
Event Engineer on the Developer Experience team at Pebble. I approached her and
expressed my desire to take a little bit of Pebble home with me to spread in Ottawa.
I had a feeling of loss when leaving the developer retreat the previous year and wanted
to prevent that when I left this time. Pebble Meetups were already taking place in
London and a couple of other locations, and I wanted to do the same in Ottawa. It was
following this Retreat that Kat put out the official
[Pebble Developer Meetup Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeYXRqw3VJ9UdFNMsBBbI2WtSm0QDzOmhhODyVbNy1Q)
for satellite Pebble Developer Meetups. With this came the birth of the Pebble Rockstar.

Pebble has become something very dear to me. I'm not just talking about the
smartwatch I love to wear and develop apps for, I mean the community of developers
and Pebble employees that add the human and emotional element to it all. I had been
quite fortunate so far to meet these people and wanted to give back to the community.
So, I decided to start up Pebble Developer Meetup Ottawa, [PebbleOTT](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleOTT/).

PebbleOTT started off as just a few people having drinks and food in a pub listening
to me talk about Pebble development, and has now grown into a bunch of people having
drinks and food in a pub getting into some serious conversations about potential apps.
Now, we’re even planning our first [Pebble Ottawa Hackathon](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleOTT/events/222726467/),
headed by Matt Langlois from Ottawa University. These Meetups are like bringing a
little part of the Developer Retreats back home, and help tide me over until the next
one. The fact that I was able to get others interested enough to want to take part in
Pebble Community Events makes this whole experience worth it. Having a little bit of
Pebble at home helps keep me actively involved in the Pebble Developer community.

Pebble Developer Meetups are a way to really immerse yourself in the Pebble developer
community. They’re a way to discuss interests, meet new people, and share ideas for
apps. For me, it has been a way to share my experience so far as a Pebble Developer
and get more people on board. We meet regularly, have a few drinks, share some food,
and are always thinking of what we can do next to grow our community.

I wasn’t asked to organize Meetups, I volunteered to do it out of passion for what
Pebble and Pebble development means to me. It’s more than compiling code and running
it on a watch: it's a community of people who are passionate about improving people's
lives by complementing the things they do throughout the day with small experiences.
It's about friendship, sharing, a pat on the back when something works, and poking
fun when the arm of your team’s Pebble controlled robot gets ripped off by another
Pebble controlled robot. Being a Pebble Rockstar and organizing Meetups in my community
is my way of staying in touch with the people and things that #MakeAwesomeHappen.
