In last week’s
[timeline blog post](/blog/2015/04/10/it-is-time-to-put-your-ideas-on-our-timeline/), 
we teased a new competition we’re running. This will be a challenge to see who
can create the coolest Pebble applications that are optimized for the Pebble
Time: we’re interested in seeing apps that use the timeline interface as well as
other awesome watchfaces and Pebble apps in color. Winners can look forward to a
Pebble Time, swag, and publicity in the Pebble developer community.

The Timeline Challenge will feature 12 winners, one per week for 12 weeks.
We’ll start announcing winners on May 4th, so you have plenty of time to develop
and submit your apps before the first deadline! Don’t worry though, you can
continue to work on your apps throughout the challenge and submit them after
the first round of the challenge, but the early bird gets the first Pebble
Times!




## What We're Looking For

We will only consider apps that were created with the Pebble Time in mind, and would
prefer to see seamless timeline integration that will add important functionality to 
Pebblers' lives. However, if you have an idea for an amazing color watchface or 
a unique watchapp, we're all eyes! 

In the coming weeks, we'll be releasing guidelines for UI components and UX best
practices. The best apps will show that you have given thought to how your
apps relate to the overall Pebble Time experience and will follow these
guidelines. Stay tuned for updates on these guides via our
[developer newsletter](http://pbl.io/devnewsletter) and make sure to
[sign up](http://pbl.io/devnewsletter) if you aren't on our list!

## How to Enter the Challenge

To be considered for the challenge, make sure you have 
[published your app](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/) to the Pebble appstore
and then fill out our [Google Form](http://goo.gl/forms/1pOhTRoxJq). Share your app 
with the world using \#timelinechallenge to get beta testers and new Pebble Time users 
to download your app!

We'll announce the winner every Monday for 12 weeks (May 4th for week 1), 
and contact the winner via email! 

If you don't win one week, don't lose hope! Your submission will roll over, and will 
be evaluated again with the next round of apps. However, you can only win once. If 
you do win, don't stop developing! We have some surprises in store for outstanding 
applications made by previous winners.  

## What’s in It for You? 

Well, we have some fantastic prizes lined up:

- An invitation to the 2015 Pebble Developer Retreat
  (including airfare and accommodation if needed)
- A Pebble Time watch 
- A $500 Amazon gift card
- A Pebble Swag Bag including PJs, Pebble Time shirt, and other goodies

In addition, we’ll feature your app on the Pebble appstore and cover it on 
the Pebble Developer Blog. 

## Getting Help with Timeline

Need some help getting your app off the ground? If you haven’t already, make sure you 
check out 
[our recent blog post on getting started with timeline](/blog/2015/03/20/Getting-Started-With-Timeline/), 
[our timeline guides](/guides/pebble-timeline/), and example applications such
as [Hello Timeline]({{site.links.examples_org}}/hello-timeline) and
[Timeline TV Tracker]({{site.links.examples_org}}/timeline-tv-tracker). 

We’ll also be showcasing timeline at our next [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleSF/events/221717043/), 
on April 23rd in San Francisco. At the event, we’ll be walking through how to create 
timeline apps as well as detailing many of the other awesome features of timeline. 
If you can’t make it to SF, join us virtually! We’ll be livestreaming the event: make 
sure you follow [PebbleDev](http://twitter.com/PebbleDev) or keep an eye on the

Love,

Team Pebble
