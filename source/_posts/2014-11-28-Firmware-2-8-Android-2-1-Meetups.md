Another newsletter detailing our new releases for the Pebble firmware, Android
and iOS apps is reproduced here for your blog reading pleasure. In addition, we 
also have some exciting news about the Pebble appstore!




## Firmware 2.8 Released

We've released the latest version of the Pebble firmware, 2.8! This includes the
following features:

* Support for receiving notifications in 80 more languages with 351 more
  characters added to the main system font. This means that the vast majority of
  users will no longer see boxes in notifications!

* Introduced a new 
  [Internationalization API](``Internationalization``) for 
  developers to begin preparing their apps for localization.

* More bug fixes and improvements.

Full changes can be found on the [Pebble Developers](/sdk/changelogs/2.8/) site.

## Pebble Appstore Updated

On Monday the Pebble appstore received an update that dramatically increases
browsing speed, enabling users to find and try out new apps faster than ever
before!

Existing users can get the new version by force-closing their Android or iOS
apps and re-opening them.

## Android 2.1 Released

The new version of the Pebble Android app, 2.1, is now available to all on the
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getpebble.android). 
This version is the full release of the beta we mentioned in the last
newsletter. At the moment it is only available to users running Android 4.3
(Jelly Bean) and above, but support for earlier versions will be returning soon!

In case you missed it, here are the new features:

* Rewritten to be faster, more reliable and a better foundation for future new
  features.

* Ability to show all notifications on the watch. Simply pick from a list of
  your installed apps!

* Ability to end in-progress calls. 

* Lots of other bug fixes and improvements.

## iOS 2.5.2 Released

The Pebble iOS app has also received some love with a new version released that
includes: 

* The latest JavaScript Pebble apps available for iOS users in the
  Pebble appstore. 

* Bug fixes and stability improvements.

## Awesome Community Links

Here are some of the things we've seen in the Pebble community recently. If you
see something you think should be included, let us know!

* The 
  ["Velocity" watchface by Ycleptic Studios](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/546b75b8bef790baf90000bb) 
  has a sleek look as well as a cool accelerometer-based watchface configuration
  solution.

* SwimIO updated their 
  ["The Kevin Pacey" swimming app](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/536d0c4dbcec8f825000026e) 
  to better help you keep track of your swimming progress.

* [JavaPay](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54527bf9d692a12cfa000081) 
  (formerly PebbleBucks) by Alexsander Akers allows you to use your Starbucks
  card from your wrist!
