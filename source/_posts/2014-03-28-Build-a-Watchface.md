This is a follow up to our first video: "Introduction to Pebble development" - We recommend you start [with that one](/blog/2014/03/27/Introduction-to-Pebble-development/) if you are new to Pebble.

This series of videos is intended for anyone with previous development experience. You certainly do not need to be a C expert but if you have never programmed, we recommend starting with [the Watchface Generator](http://www.watchface-generator.de/) or [Pebble Canvas](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pennas.pebblecanvas) (Android app).

The blog post mentioned in the video with all the Pebble system fonts [is available here](/blog/2013/07/24/Using-Pebble-System-Fonts/).

This is the complete source code built in this video:
