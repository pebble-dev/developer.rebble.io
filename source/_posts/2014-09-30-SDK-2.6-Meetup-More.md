title: Build background apps with SDK 2.6.1

Today we released SDK 2.6.1, which includes support for background workers. This
enables great activity tracking apps like Misfit and Jawbone's Up to keep
counting in the background — and you can use them too! Head over to our
[background worker guide](/guides/events-and-services/background-worker/)
and read through the [API documentation](``AppWorker``) to find out how.

We have also added APIs for direct access to the framebuffer, and to retrieve
information on the watch, including its color and firmware version.

Browse through [the release notes](/sdk/changelogs/2.6) for full details.
