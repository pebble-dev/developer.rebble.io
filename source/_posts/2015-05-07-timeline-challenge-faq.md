##Questions

**Oh no, I didn’t win this week. Do I have to make a new app to be considered
in the future?**

Nope! As we pick each week’s winner, we’re going to be looking through **ALL**
the apps that have been submitted. So, even if you submitted your app before
the first winner was chosen, you’ll still be in the running as we pick our last winner!

**Can I win multiple times?**

No, you can’t win twice. Although you won't be able to win again,
we encourage winners to keep hacking! We would love to see more exceptional apps, and
there could be suprises for you in the future!

**Do I have to use timeline?**

No, it's not a requirement. However, we would like for your apps to integrate timeline. The
timeline is such an exciting, unique way to interact with your users, and we love seeing
developers take advantage of it!

That being said, if you do make an awesome watchface or app, you'll definitely still be in
the running! We're excited to see what you make.  

**Can I submit multiple apps?**

Yes, you can submit as many apps as you want. However, as mentioned above,
you will only be able to win the challenge once.

**I’ve been improving my app for the last three weeks. Can I resubmit it?**

Of course! We would love to see the improvements you’ve made.
