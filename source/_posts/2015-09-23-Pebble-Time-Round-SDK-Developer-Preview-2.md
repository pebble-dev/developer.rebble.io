You may have heard about [Pebble Time Round]({{ site.links.pebble }}/timeround),
our newest addition to the Pebble family which adds a whole bunch of new
possibilities, challenges, and opportunities for our dedicated developers to get
creative with.

With a new platform usually comes a new SDK to play with. Well, why wait? All
developers can now get their hands on the new [SDK 3.6-dp2](/sdk/) or use it
on [CloudPebble]({{site.links.cloudpebble}}). This is a preview of the
first Pebble Time Round-compatible SDK, allowing developers to realize their
ideas for new and improved watchapps and watchfaces. Have a favorite classic
round watchface that looks cumbersome on a rectangular display? Try it out on
this one!


## New Resources

To get you started, we have updated many sections of the Pebble
Developer site with new content and information on designing and developing
for the new Pebble hardware platform, code-named Chalk. Read more on the 
[*Getting Started with Pebble Time Round*](/sdk/round-getting-started) page.


## Virtual Lab

Want help getting started with the Pebble Time Round SDK? Join us on September
24th at 1pm PDT in our Slack channel for a virtual lab
with the Pebble Dev team. Bring all your questions, and we'll do our best to
answer them!


## Compatiblity Note

Bear in mind, this is a **developer preview**, meaning that apps created with
this SDK should **not** be uploaded to the Pebble appstore, as it is subject to
possible breaking changes in new APIs before the final release of SDK 3.6.
Thanks for your cooperation!
