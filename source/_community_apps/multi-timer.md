Multi Timer is a Pebble watchapp that allows you to run several timers and
stopwatches simultaneously.

It uses [`Persistent Storage`](``Storage``) on the watch to remember your
timers, and even fakes the timers running in the background by calculating how
much time has elapsed since the app was last run and adding / removing this
amount of time from any running timers.

Some parts of the C and JS code are tested, and are run automatically using
[Travis CI][1].

The current build status of the app is: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smallstoneapps/multi-timer.png?branch=master)][2]

Here is what the app looks like:
