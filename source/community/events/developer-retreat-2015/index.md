## Overview

Now that the dust has settled from Pebbleâ€™s third annual Developer Retreat,
it's time to recap! Team Pebble and 50 of the best Pebble developers from
around the world spent four days learning about designing for round displays,
talking to our wrists, getting the first glance at Pebble Time Round,
eating our fill of delicious foods, and finally touring around San Francisco to see
the sights! It was terribly sad when it was all over and we had to go home.

But there's always next year! If you missed out this year <a href="javascript:void();" data-modal-target="#overlay-mailchimp">
let us know you're interested in next year's retreat</a>!

You can check out what the full schedule was like
[here](/community/events/developer-retreat-2015/detailed-schedule/).
We've now finished uploading all of the materials from the retreat so you can watch
along with the attendees. You can find the full content of [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/137169991@N07/albums),

### PebbleSF Meetup

We had our 1st anniversary of the PebbleSF Meetup during the retreat! Our
attendees met the rest of the local community here in the Bay Area and
socialized with more members of Team Pebble. We enjoyed delicious tacos,
drinks, community demos, and great people! Here is a list of the
presentations during the Meetup which can all be seen during the video:

* Heiko Behrens (Pebble Developer Experience Engineer) discusses developing for
  Pebble Time Round with the Meetup community.
* Nate Stockham (Project Kraepelin) talks about Wearable Psychiatry at
  Stanford, using Pebble to diagnose and continuously monitor the
  most devastating psychiatric disorders.
* Anthony Paglino (Seeed Studio) talks about Pebble + Xadow Module and
  what this means for smartstraps.
* Mathew Reiss (Retreat Attendee) talks about Simple Dithering Library,
  a simple concept that drastically opens up the range of perceivable
  colors on the Pebble Time.

### Side Sessions (Day 3)

#### PebbleAMS Live!

We did our first live Google Hangout with the developers at a [Pebble Meetup in Amsterdam](http://www.meetup.com/PebbleAMS/events/225180284/)! Jaron and Kristof of [Kiezel Watchfaces](https://www.kiezelwatchfaces.com/) gave us a hint of [KiezelPay](https://kiezelpay.com/). You can sign up to learn more about in-app payments without creating your own mobile clients on their website.

#### Pebble Meetups Group Discussion

A group discussion hosted by Kat McAuliffe (Event Engineer) about the worldwide Pebble Meetups. The feedback from this session helped spawn the new [Meetup Website](/community/events/meetups/)! If you're interested in recreating a piece of the developer retreat where you live, please contact us using that page's contact form.

#### The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

A group discussion hosted by Katharine Berry (Developer Tools Manager)
about Pebble APIs and Tools. This session filled the boardroom to capacity with retreat attendees who eagerly wanted to put forward their ideas and experiences of developing for Pebble. This session was a great success and this valuable feedback is being reviewed internally by the relevant teams and the requests will hopefully be integrated into future development plans.

#### A Community of Pebblers!

A group discussion hosted by Jon Barlow (Developer Advocate) about the Pebble
community. Forums, Slack, surveys, code samples, our newsletter, and community projects are just a few of the things we covered during this session. We got a lot of feedback about devsupport that we've already put in practice and response times will keep getting better! We love how much Slack has helped us connect with our community and to each other!

### Presentations

#### Data Analytics and Pebble 

Jack Chai (Data Scientist) takes us through the new Developer Portal analytics
and delves into battery performance. He also reveals some interesting
insights into levels of user interaction and how your projects could benefit
from integration with timeline.

#### Demos and Closing Ceremonies

It was a whirlwind of code, design, friendships, and collaboration after 3 days
at the retreat. We gave everyone the chance to demo what they had been working
on (see mark 5:03 for demos) to the audience and then we recapped the event.

Segway Tour of Golden Gate Park, Segway Tour of Fishermanâ€™s Wharf, and
Motorized Cable Car City Tour. Photos below capture attendee's collective
photos of the day, let us know if you have ones to share that aren't
