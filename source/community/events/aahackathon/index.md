Welcome to the American Airlines / Gogo in flight / Wearable World Hackathon!
</big>

Pebble is very excited to support this hackathon with some Pebbles and technical support, available online during the hackathon.

# First steps

First things first, if you have not done so, please claim your Pebble with the organizers. Every team gets one Pebble. To set up your Pebble, you will need the iOS or Android Pebble application. You can follow installation instructions on [go.getpebble.com](http://go.getpebble.com).

There are different ways to do Pebble development:

 - For a very quick start, we recommend that you use the [CloudPebble]({{site.links.cloudpebble}}) web IDE. With CloudPebble, it will only take you a few minutes to build your first Pebble application and deploy it on your watch.

 - You can also download and install the Pebble SDK on Linux and MacOS. Instructions are [on our developer website](/sdk/).

# Choose your weapons

In the context of this specific hackathons, you can build different type of applications. We recommend that you choose one of the three following scenarios:

 - Use [Pebble.js][pebblejs] to write an application completely in JavaScript.
 - Use [Pebble C SDK](/guides/) to write a Pebble app in C, and use some JavaScript to connect your application to the Internet
 - Use [PebbleKit iOS and Android](/guides/communication/) to connect an iOS or Android application to Pebble.

# Need an example?

To help you get started, we have built a simple [Pebble.js][pebblejs] application that uses the Gogo In Flight API to show some information about the current flight.

This is what it looks like:

And this is the source code:

Feel free to use and modify that example!
