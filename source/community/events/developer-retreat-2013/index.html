        This event is reserved to developers who have already published an application for Pebble, or created a smartphone application that works with Pebble. Due to limited space, we will select developers who are creating the most interesting apps and have projects that could benefit the most from direct support. If you live outside of the Bay Area, we will be able to sponsor a limited number of people to travel in for this retreat (hotel and flight paid for by Pebble), so please don't let that stop you from applying!
