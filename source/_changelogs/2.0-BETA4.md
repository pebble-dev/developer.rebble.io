 * Pebble SDK 2.0 is currently in BETA and intended for developers only.
 * SDK 2.0 will be released early next year as an over-the-air update to all Pebble users.
 * Applications written for Pebble 1.x are not compatible with SDK 2.0
 * If a 2.0 version of an application exists, the Pebble mobile applications will automatically install it when when a user upgrades her/his Pebble.

**You can start uploading your application to the Pebble appstore TODAY - [Please do so](http://dev-portal.rebble.io/)!**
