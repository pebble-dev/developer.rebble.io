## Develop Online

You can use [CloudPebble]({{ site.links.cloudpebble }}) to build, compile
and test Pebble apps entirely in the cloud without any installation needed.

## Install Through Homebrew

We recommend Mac OS X users [install the SDK using Homebrew](/sdk/download).

## Manual Installation

Once you have [downloaded the Pebble SDK](/sdk/download/), you will need to
follow the instructions for your platform.

## [Mac OS X](/sdk/install/mac/) | [Linux](/sdk/install/linux/) | [Windows](/sdk/install/windows/)

### Problems Installing?

If you need help installing the SDK, feel free to post your comments in the
[SDK Installation Help forum][sdk-install-help]. Please make sure you
provide as many details as you can about the issues
you may have encountered.

**Tip:** Copying and pasting commands from your Terminal output will help a great deal.
